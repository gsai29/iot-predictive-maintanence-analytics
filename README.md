# IoT device Predictive Maintenance and Management
By Vignesh Sundaram, Sai Manikandan, Shrishailya Chavan
## Goal
- Our ultimate goal is to build a non-exclusive end-to-end IoT device predictive maintenance and management solution, from on-field devices all the way to a web console.


## Repository structure
- `code/iot_project.ipynb`: the main code for our project, including modules for:
  1. Data ETL/EDA
  2. Model Training
  3. Model Testing
  4. Anomaly Detection Fitting/Testing
  5. Plot
- `dataset/demo_data.zip`: The raw dataset we actually used for final result.

The backend is a Flask application and front end is developed using React.js. We are able to monitor the data received from the sensors and predict the future state of the devices and detect any anomalies if present.
Some of the pictures from the application are as follows:
